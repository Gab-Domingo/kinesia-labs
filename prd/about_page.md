# 🧩 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project: Kinesia Labs — “About” Page Redesign

**Date:** October 2025
**Owner:** Kinesia Labs Web Development Team
**Contributors:** Design Lead, Content Strategist, Developer
**Priority:** High

---

## 1. 🔍 Background & Problem Statement

The current About page provides basic information (mission, research story, and team expertise) but lacks depth and authenticity. It feels like a placeholder rather than a showcase of the lab’s credibility and innovation.

Visitors (students, collaborators, investors, or potential users) should leave this page believing *Kinesia Labs* is a **real, research-active AI-bioengineering lab** driving innovation in **muscle-intent decoding, AI signal processing, and human–AI interfaces.**

---

## 2. 🎯 Objectives

* To redesign the “About” page to **convey legitimacy, depth, and purpose.**
* To **build trust** by showcasing research credibility, leadership, and tangible impact.
* To **visually align** the page with the sophistication of an advanced AI–biomedical research organization.
* To enhance **engagement** through storytelling and dynamic, scroll-based content.

## 3. 👥 Target Audience

| Audience                      | Needs                                                       | Desired Takeaway                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Researchers / Universities    | Want to see serious scientific direction and team expertise | “This lab is doing real, impactful R&D.”                     |
| Potential Collaborators       | Need to know mission, focus, and capabilities               | “Kinesia Labs could be a partner in EMG/AI signal projects.” |
| Students / Interns            | Curious about lab culture and vision                        | “I want to learn or work here.”                              |
| Industry Partners / Investors | Need trust and technological confidence                     | “This is an emerging neurotech startup worth following.”     |

---

## 4. 🧠 Key Insights

* The page currently has minimal differentiation between **mission, story, and expertise**.
* Visitors expect **visual storytelling, real projects, leadership faces (optional), and clear research outcomes.**
* The dark theme is elegant — it should be **kept**, but enhanced with **motion and interactive content.**

---

## 5. 📄 Content Structure (Proposed Layout)

### **A. Hero Section (Top Fold)**

* **Headline:** “Redefining Human–AI Interaction Through Muscle Intent Decoding.”
* **Subheadline:** “We’re pioneering neuroadaptive interfaces that bridge biology and artificial intelligence.”
* **Visual Element:**

  * Subtle **Lottie animation** of EMG waveforms or neuron-like signals connecting to robotic motion.
  * Animated tagline fade-in.

---

### **B. Our Mission**

* **Current:** “Our mission is to redefine how people interact with AI through muscle intent decoding.”

* **Enhanced:**

  > “At Kinesia Labs, we envision a world where human intent seamlessly translates into intelligent action. Our mission is to harness electromyography (EMG) and AI to create intuitive assistive systems that empower mobility, expression, and independence.”

* Add subtle **AI + human silhouette background** animation.

---

### **C. The Research Journey (Storytelling Section)**

**Title:** “Our Story of Innovation”

* **Content Narrative:**

  * Origin story: “Kinesia Labs began as a university-led research group exploring how muscle signals could be decoded for real-world control.”
  * Current direction: “Today, we’re developing next-generation EMG-based interfaces for assistive robotics, rehabilitation, and AI-powered prosthetics.”
  * Future vision: “We aim to close the loop between biology and computation, making AI systems that understand the human body’s language.”
* Include **timeline or milestone cards** (e.g., 2023 prototype, 2024 EMG filtering breakthrough, 2025 clinical validation).

---

### **D. Research Focus Areas**

Use three visually separated cards or horizontal scroll blocks:

1. **AI Signal Processing** – Real-time EMG decoding and adaptive filtering.
2. **Biomedical Engineering** – Integrating sensors, prosthetics, and control systems.
3. **Human–AI Synergy** – Designing interfaces that respond naturally to human intent.

Each should have:

* Icon or 3D Lottie element.
* One-sentence description.

---

### **E. Team Expertise**

* Present as **modular profiles or team capability badges.**

* Add actual profiles (optional for future update) Use Chroma grid.

---

### **F. Recognition & Collaborations (Optional Section)**

* Logos of academic partners, hackathon wins, or publication mentions.
* Call-to-action: “Collaborate with us → [Contact Page Link]”

---

### **G. Closing Message**

> “Kinesia Labs is more than a research space—it’s a movement toward accessible, human-centered technology.”
> Button: **Explore Our Research →**

## 6. 🎨 Design & UI Guidelines

| Element           | Requirement                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Theme**         | Maintain black/dark background; add soft gradients and motion.                 |
| **Typography**    | Serif for headings (authority), Sans-serif for body (readability).             |
| **Animations**    | Subtle Lottie or Framer Motion effects for sections.                           |
| **Layout**        | Split-screen sections with text on one side, visual or animation on the other. |
| **Interaction**   | Scroll-triggered reveals for each section.                                     |
| **Accessibility** | Maintain color contrast > 4.5:1 and semantic HTML tags.                        |
