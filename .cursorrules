# .cursorrules — Kinesia Labs Website Redesign
# ==========================================
# Purpose:
# Ensures Cursor + v0 maintain consistent design logic, tone, and layout
# when expanding the startup hero template into a multi-page site.
# ==========================================

project:
  name: "Kinesia Labs Website"
  description: >
    A futuristic, research-driven landing site for Kinesia Labs — 
    a deep tech startup developing an invasive EMG armband that 
    enables wheelchair and hardware control through muscle intent decoding.

rules:
  - Always preserve the *core aesthetic and structure* of the original v0 startup hero template.
  - Any redesign must reflect **Kinesia Labs’ identity**: deep tech, credible, visionary, and research-oriented.
  - Maintain *semantic HTML* and *clean component hierarchy* in all code output.
  - Use *modular sections* for scalability (e.g., separate components for hero, features, industries, FAQs, etc.).
  - Default styling framework should match the template (Tailwind CSS if available).
  - Typography: tech-inspired sans-serif for headings, humanist sans-serif for body.
  - Keep the feel *minimal yet advanced*, avoiding clutter or heavy animations.

pages:
  - Home:
      purpose: "Introduce the EMG armband and demonstrate wheelchair control capability."
      include:
        - Hero section with headline: "Redefining Human–Machine Interaction"
        - Subheadline: "Kinesia Labs pioneers EMG-driven interfaces that let humans control machines through muscle intent."
        - CTAs: ["Contact Us"]
        - Proof of Concept section (wheelchair control demo)
        - Research insight snippet or animation
        - Footer with navigation + contact info

  - About:
      purpose: "Present Kinesia Labs’ mission, research foundation, and team."
      include:
        - Mission statement
        - Research story or founding motivation
        - Team expertise: AI, biomedical engineering, robotics

  - Industries:
      purpose: "Show cross-sector potential applications of EMG-AI integration."
      include:
        - Healthcare & Accessibility
        - Defense & Military
        - Industrial Robotics
        - Exoskeleton & Hardware Control

  - Research:
      purpose: "Explain signal filtering and intent decoding innovations."
      include:
        - Simplified diagram placeholder for EMG signal-to-action
        - Notes on latency, precision, and ethical AI
        - Optional data visualization or animation placeholder

  - FAQs:
      purpose: "Answer common questions and clarify tech basics."
      include:
        - What is EMG?
        - Is it invasive or non-invasive?
        - How accurate is control?
        - Who can use the product?
        - How to connect to hardware?

  - Contact:
      purpose: "Generate leads and collaborations."
      include:
        - Lead form
        - Email and LinkedIn links
        - Footer legal note

behavior:
  - Do not remove or drastically alter existing UI structure unless requested.
  - Always ensure consistent navigation and routing across all pages.
  - Keep text concise, technically clear, and inspiring.
  - Prefer modern interaction patterns (smooth scroll, hover effects, light motion).
  - All assets, animations, or videos must be modular and optional for later integration.
  - Optimize for accessibility, SEO, and responsive design by default.
  - Maintain strict component reusability — avoid redundant styling or inline CSS.

ai_guidance:
  - When generating new sections or pages:
      * Match typography scale and spacing with the base template.
      * Respect existing color palette logic.
      * Prioritize clarity over decoration.
  - When updating copy:
      * Keep tone confident, research-driven, and visionary.
      * Avoid generic marketing buzzwords.
      * Communicate innovation through clarity and focus.

outputs:
  - Generate complete, working components (React/Tailwind preferred).
  - Include placeholder images or diagram references where needed.
  - Maintain readability and logical file naming conventions.
  - Ensure all generated code runs standalone within the existing template structure.
